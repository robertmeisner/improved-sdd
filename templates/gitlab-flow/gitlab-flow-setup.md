## GitLab Flow Setup

Before starting the spec development workflow, set up your GitLab Flow branch structure to enable proper version control and collaboration.

### Repository Status Check

First, verify your repository status and ensure you're on the main branch:

```bash
# Check current repository status
{GIT_STATUS}

# Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```

### Create Feature Branch

Create a dedicated feature branch for this specification:

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
{BRANCH_CREATE}
```

**Branch Naming Convention**: `feature/spec-{kebab-case-name}`

**Examples**:
- "User Authentication" → `feature/spec-user-authentication`
- "Payment System" → `feature/spec-payment-system`
- "Data Migration" → `feature/spec-data-migration`
- "API Integration" → `feature/spec-api-integration`

### Repository Validation

**✅ Pre-Workflow Checklist**:
- [ ] Repository is clean (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] On main branch and up to date
- [ ] Feature branch created with proper naming
- [ ] Ready to begin spec development

### Workflow Integration

This GitLab Flow setup enables:
- **Isolated Development**: Work on feature branch without affecting main
- **Incremental Progress**: Commit each spec phase (feasibility, requirements, design, tasks)
- **Collaborative Review**: Create PR after implementation completion
- **Version Control**: Track spec evolution and implementation progress

**Next Steps**: Begin with feasibility assessment while tracking progress through commits.
