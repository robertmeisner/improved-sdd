## GitLab Flow Workflow Integration

This section provides comprehensive GitLab Flow guidance that integrates seamlessly with the specification workflow. Follow these practices to maintain proper version control and collaboration throughout the spec development process.

### Phase-Based Progress Tracking

After completing and approving each phase of the specification workflow, commit your progress to maintain version control and enable collaboration.

#### When to Commit

**Commit after each phase approval:**
- âœ… Feasibility assessment approved
- âœ… Requirements document approved  
- âœ… Design document approved
- âœ… Task list approved
- âœ… Individual implementation tasks completed

#### Commit Command

Use the following command to commit your current phase:

```bash
# Stage and commit phase completion
{COMMIT}
```

### Commit Message Templates

Use these conventional commit message formats for consistency:

#### Feasibility Phase
```
feat: Add feasibility assessment for {feature-name}

- Assess technical requirements and complexity
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Estimate effort and resources needed
- Document recommendation and next steps
```

#### Requirements Phase
```
feat: Add requirements for {feature-name}

- Define user stories and acceptance criteria
- Specify success metrics and out-of-scope items
- Document functional and non-functional requirements
- Establish testing scenarios and edge cases
```

#### Design Phase
```
feat: Add design for {feature-name}

- Define system architecture and components
- Specify data models and API contracts
- Document security and performance considerations
- Plan testing strategy and rollback procedures
```

#### Tasks Phase
```
feat: Add implementation tasks for {feature-name}

- Break down design into actionable coding tasks
- Prioritize critical path and parallel work
- Estimate effort and identify dependencies
- Plan incremental development approach
```

#### Implementation Progress
```
feat: Implement {specific-task-name} for {feature-name}

- Complete task {task-number}: {task-description}
- Add comprehensive test coverage
- Update documentation and comments
- Validate against requirements
```

### Best Practices

**âœ… Good Commit Practices:**
- [ ] Descriptive commit message following conventional format
- [ ] Single logical change per commit
- [ ] All related files included
- [ ] Phase completely finished before committing

**ðŸ“‹ Incremental Progress Tracking:**
- Each spec phase gets its own commit
- Implementation tasks committed individually
- Progress visible through commit history
- Enables easy rollback if needed

### Workflow Integration Benefits

This GitLab Flow integration enables:
- **Isolated Development**: Work on feature branch without affecting main
- **Incremental Progress**: Commit each spec phase for safety
- **Collaborative Review**: Share progress with team members
- **Version Control**: Track spec evolution and implementation progress
- **Risk Mitigation**: Easy rollback if issues arise

**Next Phase**: Continue to next workflow phase or proceed with implementation tasks.
