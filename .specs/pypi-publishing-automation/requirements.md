## Functional Requirements

### **FR-1: Publishing Workflow**
**Priority**: Must Have  
**User Story**: As a developer, I want packages automatically published so that users can install the latest version without manual intervention.

**Functional Specification**:
1. **TestPyPI Publishing** (on master push):
   - Trigger: Push to master branch
   - Condition: All CI workflows pass
   - Action: Build and publish to TestPyPI
   - Verification: Install and test from TestPyPI

2. **PyPI Publishing** (on version tag):
   - Trigger: Git tag starting with 'v' (e.g., v1.2.3)
   - Condition: All CI workflows pass
   - Action: Build and publish to PyPI
   - Post-action: Create GitHub release

### **FR-2: Safety and Error Handling**
**Priority**: Must Have  
**User Story**: As a maintainer, I want comprehensive safety checks so that broken packages never reach users.

**Functional Specification**:
1. **Pre-publish Validation**:
   - Run critical test suite
   - Verify CLI functionality
   - Check package integrity
   - Validate version format

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Clear error messages in workflow logs
   - Notification of failures
   - Rollback procedures documented
   - Manual override capabilities

### **FR-3: Developer Experience**
**Priority**: Should Have  
**User Story**: As a developer, I want easy version management tools so that creating releases is simple and error-free.

**Functional Specification**:
1. **Version Management Utility**:
   - Command: `python tools/bump_version.py bump [major|minor|patch]`
   - Features: Dry-run mode, automatic pyproject.toml updates
   - Output: Next steps for git tagging and pushing

2. **Release Documentation**:
   - Automated release notes
   - Installation instructions
   - Changelog integration
   - Package metadata display

## Non-Functional Requirements
