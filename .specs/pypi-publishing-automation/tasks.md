- GitHub repository admin access for secrets management
- Existing CI/CD workflows must be stable

### **Internal Dependencies**
- Current project must have valid `pyproject.toml`
- Existing GitHub Actions infrastructure
- Repository branch protection rules (if any)
- Development team access to repository settings

### **Potential Blockers**
- PyPI/TestPyPI account approval delays
- GitHub repository permission restrictions
- Existing workflow conflicts or incompatibilities
- Network access restrictions in GitHub Actions

## Risk Mitigation Plans

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Workflow Dependency Failures**
   - **Risk**: Publishing occurs despite CI failures
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive dependency checking and testing
   - **Fallback**: Manual workflow triggers with explicit checks

2. **Token Security Issues**
   - **Risk**: API token exposure or compromise
   - **Mitigation**: GitHub secrets, minimal permissions, regular rotation
   - **Fallback**: Immediate token revocation and regeneration procedures

3. **Package Publishing Failures**
   - **Risk**: Broken packages reaching users
   - **Mitigation**: Multi-stage validation and testing
   - **Fallback**: Quick rollback via new version publication

### **Operational Risks**
1. **Team Knowledge Gaps**
   - **Risk**: Team unable to maintain or troubleshoot system
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and training
   - **Fallback**: Manual publishing procedures as backup

2. **Service Dependencies**
