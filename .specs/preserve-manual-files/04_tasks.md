# Implementation Tasks

## Task Prioritization Matrix

### Critical Path (Sequential)
- Core configuration system must be implemented first
- AI tool management depends on configuration
- File management requires AI tool system
- Delete command integration ties everything together

### Parallel Work (Simultaneous)
- Configuration validation can be developed alongside core config
- User interface components can be built independently
- Testing can be written in parallel with implementation

### Optional Enhancements (Nice-to-have)
- Advanced error handling patterns
- Performance optimizations
- Enhanced logging and monitoring

**Progress Summary:** 0% complete - All tasks not yet started
**Estimated Total Effort:** ~44 hours
**Critical Path Duration:** ~20 hours (sequential tasks)

## Implementation Gap Analysis

**What's Missing:**
- Complete YAML configuration system
- AI tool management with managed file lists
- File conflict detection and user interaction
- Enhanced delete command with preservation logic
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Why It's Missing:**
- Current system uses simple directory globbing without file origin tracking
- No configuration system exists for user customization
- Delete command lacks precision and safety mechanisms

## Next Steps

1. **Start with Task 1.1** - Begin with configuration system as foundation
2. **Follow critical path** - Implement tasks in dependency order
3. **Add tests incrementally** - Write tests alongside implementation
4. **Validate with manual testing** - Test each component as it's completed

**Ready to begin implementation!** All tasks are actionable and have clear acceptance criteria linked to requirements.
