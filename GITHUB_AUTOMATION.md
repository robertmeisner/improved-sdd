# GitHub Automation Documentation

## Overview

This project now has comprehensive GitHub automation that checks **everything** on every push and pull request. The CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality, security, and functionality across multiple environments.

## What GitHub Checks

### ✅ Comprehensive Test Suite
- **Unit Tests**: 45 tests covering all core functionality with 72% code coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 7 working integration tests plus cross-platform validation
- **CLI Testing**: All CLI commands tested with typer.testing.CliRunner
- **Multi-Python Support**: Tests run on Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12

### ✅ Code Quality & Formatting
- **Black**: Code formatting consistency (120 character line length)
- **isort**: Import statement organization
- **flake8**: Python linting and style guide enforcement
- **mypy**: Static type checking

### ✅ Security Scanning
- **safety**: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- **bandit**: Static security analysis for Python code
- **pip-audit**: Additional dependency audit
- **dependency-review**: GitHub native dependency scanning on PRs

### ✅ Multi-Platform Testing
- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu, Windows, macOS
- **Python Versions**: 3.9 and 3.11 on all platforms
- **CLI Installation**: Verified on all platforms
- **Command Execution**: Basic CLI functionality tested

### ✅ Build Verification
- **Package Building**: Creates wheel and source distributions
- **Package Validation**: Verifies package integrity with twine
- **Artifact Upload**: Stores build artifacts for inspection

## Workflow Files

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
Main CI/CD pipeline that runs on every push and PR:

```yaml
Jobs:
- test: Full test suite on Python 3.8-3.12
- security: Security scanning with safety and bandit
- build: Package building and validation
- integration-test: Cross-platform CLI testing
```

### `.github/workflows/security.yml`
Security-focused workflow that runs weekly and on main branch pushes:

```yaml
Jobs:
- security-scan: Comprehensive security audit
- dependency-review: PR dependency analysis
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

Local development quality gates (install with `pre-commit install`):

- ✅ Trailing whitespace removal
- ✅ End-of-file fixing
- ✅ YAML validation
- ✅ Large file prevention
- ✅ Merge conflict detection
- ✅ Debug statement detection
- ✅ Black formatting
- ✅ isort import sorting
- ✅ flake8 linting
- ✅ mypy type checking
- ✅ bandit security scanning
- ✅ Unit test execution

## Running Tests Locally

### Quick Test Run
```bash
python test_runner.py
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
# Run all tests with coverage
pytest tests/unit/ tests/integration/test_simple_integration.py --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit          # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration   # Integration tests only
pytest -m cli           # CLI tests only
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
python tasks.py test-unit        # Unit tests
python tasks.py test-integration # Integration tests
python tasks.py test-coverage    # With coverage report
python tasks.py test-verbose     # Verbose output
```

## Coverage Information

Current test coverage: **72%**

**Covered Areas:**
- ✅ CLI command parsing and validation
- ✅ Core utility functions (file operations, user input)
- ✅ Template and project management
- ✅ Configuration handling
- ✅ Error handling and logging

**Areas for Future Coverage:**
- Advanced template directory resolution edge cases
- Complex workflow integrations
- Some error handling branches

## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .[dev,test]

# Set up pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Make changes and test
python test_runner.py
```

### 2. GitHub Integration
- **Every Push**: Full CI/CD pipeline runs automatically
- **Pull Requests**: All checks must pass before merge
- **Weekly**: Security audit runs automatically
- **Artifacts**: Test results and build artifacts saved

### 3. Quality Gates

**Pre-commit (Local):**
- Formatting, linting, type checking
- Unit tests must pass
- Security scan passes

**GitHub CI (Remote):**
- Multi-Python testing
- Cross-platform validation
- Security audit
- Build verification
- Coverage reporting

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### View Test Results
1. Go to GitHub Actions tab in repository
2. Click on any workflow run
3. Expand job details to see test output

### Coverage Reports
- **GitHub**: Uploaded to Codecov automatically
- **Local**: Generated in `htmlcov/` directory after running tests

### Security Reports
- **Weekly**: Automated security scans
- **PR Reviews**: Dependency review on pull requests
- **Artifacts**: Security reports stored as workflow artifacts

### Build Artifacts
- **Wheels**: Python package distributions
- **Source**: Source distributions
- **Test Results**: JUnit XML test reports

## Troubleshooting

### Test Failures
```bash
# Debug specific test
pytest tests/unit/test_cli_commands.py::test_help_command -v

# Run with debugging
pytest --pdb tests/unit/test_cli_commands.py::test_help_command
```

### Security Issues
```bash
# Check dependencies locally
safety check
bandit -r src
```

### Build Issues
```bash
# Test build locally
python -m build
python -m twine check dist/*
```

## Summary

✅ **GitHub now checks EVERYTHING:**

1. **Code Quality**: Formatting, linting, type checking
2. **Testing**: 52 tests across unit and integration suites
3. **Security**: Dependency and code security scanning
4. **Compatibility**: Multi-Python and multi-OS testing
5. **Build**: Package creation and validation
6. **Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage reporting

The automation ensures that every change is thoroughly validated before it reaches the main branch, providing confidence in code quality and security.
