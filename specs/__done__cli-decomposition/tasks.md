# CLI Decomposition Implementation Plan

## Task Prioritization Matrix

### Critical Path (Sequential)
Tasks that must be completed in order due to dependencies:
- Module structure setup → Core layer → Service layer → Command layer → Integration

### Parallel Work (Simultaneous)
Tasks that can be worked on independently:
- Unit tests can be written alongside module extraction
- Documentation updates can happen in parallel with coding

### Optional Enhancements (Nice-to-have)
Features that add value but aren't required for core decomposition:
- Advanced performance optimizations
- Enhanced debugging utilities
- Extended error context

## Progress Summary
**Overall Completion**: 20.0% (3/15 tasks completed)
**Status**: Module structure foundation established, migration safety infrastructure skipped, ready for service protocol definitions

## Implementation Gap Analysis
**What's Missing**: All core decomposition work - currently have design documents and basic module structure
**Why**: This is a comprehensive refactoring requiring protocol-based architecture for clean separation
**Next Steps**: Begin with Task 2.1 (centralized configuration with compatibility layer) now that core models are established
