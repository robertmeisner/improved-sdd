# Implementation Plan

## Task Prioritization Matrix

### Critical Path (Sequential)
Tasks that must be completed in order for core functionality:
1. Template resolution infrastructure
2. File system operations (rename bundled templates)
3. GitHub download implementation
4. Cache management system

### Parallel Work (Simultaneous)
Tasks that can be worked on independently:
- Error handling classes and utilities
- CLI option additions
- Template validation logic
- Progress reporting components

### Optional Enhancements (Nice-to-have)
Features that add value but aren't required for basic functionality:
- Advanced CLI configuration options
- Detailed logging and observability
- Performance optimizations

## Progress Summary
**Overall Completion**: 33.3% (5/15 tasks completed)
**Implementation Status**: PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED - Template resolution infrastructure complete with bundled template rename. Ready for GitHub integration.
**Critical Blockers**: None - ready to continue with Task 3.1 (GitHub download system) or parallel tasks

## Implementation Gap Analysis
**Missing Core Components**:
- GitHub integration (no HTTP client or download capability)
- Cache management (no temporary directory handling)
- User space protection (no safeguards for .sdd_templates folders)

**Architecture Gaps**:
- No progress reporting for long operations
- No validation of template integrity
- Limited error handling for network/file system issues
