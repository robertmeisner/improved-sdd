# Requirements Document

## Introduction

**Improved-SDD** is a comprehensive Spec-Driven Development toolkit that provides customizable templates for AI-assisted software development. Building on the foundation of GitHub's spec-kit, this project enables teams to build software systematically through requirements-driven workflows with enhanced AI assistant integration.

**Current Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - This is the foundational specification for the project

## Success Metrics

- **Template Adoption**: 90% of projects using custom templates show improved consistency
- **AI Integration**: Support for 4+ major AI assistants (Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini)
- **Cross-Platform Usage**: 100% functionality on Windows, with roadmap for macOS/Linux
- **Quality Improvement**: 75% reduction in spec-code synchronization issues
- **Developer Experience**: 80% positive feedback on workflow efficiency

## Out of Scope

- Real-time collaboration features (planned for v1.2)
- Visual template editors (planned for v1.1)
- Advanced analytics and metrics (planned for v1.2)
- Template marketplace (future consideration)
- Non-spec-driven development workflows

- Scenario 3: Apply double-check prompt for quality validation
- Scenario 4: Create custom prompt for domain-specific tasks

**Implementation Status**: IMPLEMENTED - Multiple prompt templates created including analyzeProject, executeTask, and doubleCheck

### Requirement 4 [P1]

**User Story:** As a Windows developer, I want PowerShell scripts for project management, so that I can efficiently manage spec-driven development workflows in my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts are executed THEN they SHALL provide both interactive and JSON output modes
2. WHEN feature creation is requested THEN the system SHALL create proper branch and directory structure
3. WHEN planning setup is needed THEN the system SHALL initialize required specification documents
4. WHEN prerequisites are checked THEN the system SHALL validate all required documents exist

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Create new feature with proper branch naming
- Scenario 2: Set up planning documents for existing feature
- Scenario 3: Check prerequisites with comprehensive validation
- Scenario 4: Handle error conditions gracefully

**Implementation Status**: IMPLEMENTED - PowerShell scripts created for Windows environment with full functionality

### Requirement 5 [P1]

**User Story:** As a project stakeholder, I want constitutional principles enforced, so that all development follows consistent quality standards and architectural guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN constitutional principles are defined THEN they SHALL cover all aspects of development methodology
2. WHEN quality gates are implemented THEN they SHALL require explicit user approval at each phase
3. WHEN violations occur THEN the system SHALL document justifications and alternative approaches
4. WHEN principles evolve THEN the system SHALL provide structured update processes

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Enforce quality gates during spec development
- Scenario 2: Document constitutional violations with justifications
- Scenario 3: Update constitution with proper change management
- Scenario 4: Validate principle compliance across templates

**Implementation Status**: IMPLEMENTED - Constitutional framework created with comprehensive principles and update processes

### Requirement 6 [P2]

**User Story:** As a developer using multiple AI assistants, I want cross-platform compatibility, so that I can use the same templates and workflows regardless of my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN templates are created THEN they SHALL work with Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Gemini CLI
2. WHEN scripts are provided THEN they SHALL support Windows environments with PowerShell
