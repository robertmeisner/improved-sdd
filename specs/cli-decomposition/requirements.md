# CLI Decomposition Requirements

## Introduction

The improved-sdd CLI has grown to over 2000 lines in a single file, making it difficult to maintain, test, and extend. This specification defines the requirements for decomposing the monolithic CLI into a modular, maintainable structure while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining backward compatibility.

**Current Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Currently a single monolithic file

## Success Metrics

- **Maintainability**: Each module contains < 400 lines of code
- **Test Coverage**: Each module achieves > 90% unit test coverage
- **Performance**: CLI startup time remains within 10% of current performance
- **Zero Regression**: All existing CLI functionality works identically
- **Import Structure**: Clean module dependencies with no circular imports

## Out of Scope

- Changes to CLI command interface or behavior
- New features or functionality additions
- Performance optimizations beyond maintaining current speed
- Changes to external dependencies or requirements
- User-facing documentation updates (internal code only)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Module Separation [P0]

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the CLI code organized into logical modules, so that I can easily locate and modify specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the codebase THEN the CLI SHALL be organized into distinct modules based on functional concerns
2. WHEN a module is opened THEN it SHALL contain no more than 400 lines of code
3. WHEN looking for specific functionality THEN it SHALL be located in an appropriately named module
4. WHEN importing modules THEN there SHALL be no circular import dependencies

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Verify each module is under 400 lines
- Scenario 2: Test that all modules can be imported without circular dependency errors
- Scenario 3: Validate that related functionality is grouped in the same module

**Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Current monolithic structure

### Requirement 2: Preserved CLI Interface [P0]

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the CLI to work exactly as before, so that my existing scripts and workflows are not broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running any existing CLI command THEN the CLI SHALL produce functionally equivalent output and behavior
2. WHEN using command-line arguments THEN they SHALL be parsed and processed identically
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the error messages SHALL provide equivalent information (may improve formatting/context)
4. WHEN the CLI starts THEN the startup time SHALL not increase by more than 10%
5. WHEN memory usage is measured THEN it SHALL not increase by more than 15%

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Run integration tests comparing old vs new CLI behavior
- Scenario 2: Verify all command-line options work identically
- Scenario 3: Test error handling produces same messages

**Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Interface preservation required during refactoring

### Requirement 3: Configuration Management [P1]

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration constants centralized, so that I can easily modify AI tools and app types without hunting through multiple files.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN adding new app types THEN they SHALL be defined in the centralized configuration
3. WHEN configuration is needed THEN modules SHALL import from a consistent config interface
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN dependent modules SHALL automatically reflect updates

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Modify AI_TOOLS config and verify it affects all dependent modules
- Scenario 2: Add a new app type and verify CLI recognizes it
- Scenario 3: Test configuration isolation between modules

**Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Constants currently embedded in main file

### Requirement 4: Service Layer Abstraction [P1]

**User Story:** As a developer, I want core services (file tracking, caching, downloading) isolated, so that I can test and modify them independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations are needed THEN they SHALL be handled through a dedicated FileTracker service
2. WHEN caching is required THEN it SHALL be managed by an isolated CacheManager service
3. WHEN downloading templates THEN it SHALL be handled by a separate GitHubDownloader service
4. WHEN resolving templates THEN it SHALL use a dedicated TemplateResolver service
5. WHEN services are tested THEN they SHALL be unit testable in isolation

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Test FileTracker independently without CLI dependencies
- Scenario 2: Test CacheManager with mock filesystem operations
- Scenario 3: Test GitHubDownloader with mock HTTP responses
- Scenario 4: Test TemplateResolver with various source scenarios

**Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Services currently embedded in main CLI file

### Requirement 5: Error Handling Consistency [P1]

**User Story:** As a developer, I want error handling centralized, so that all modules use consistent exception types and error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur in any module THEN they SHALL use exceptions from a centralized hierarchy
2. WHEN exceptions are raised THEN they SHALL provide consistent error message formats
3. WHEN handling errors THEN modules SHALL not need to import CLI-specific error handling
4. WHEN new error types are needed THEN they SHALL extend the existing exception hierarchy

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Verify all modules use centralized exception types
- Scenario 2: Test error message consistency across modules
- Scenario 3: Validate exception hierarchy is properly organized

**Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Exception classes currently in main file

### Requirement 6: UI/Console Abstraction [P2]

**User Story:** As a developer, I want console operations abstracted, so that UI logic is separated from business logic and can be easily modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules need console output THEN they SHALL use a consistent console interface
2. WHEN progress reporting is needed THEN it SHALL be handled through dedicated progress utilities
3. WHEN UI styling changes THEN only UI modules SHALL need modification
4. WHEN testing modules THEN console operations SHALL be easily mockable

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Test business logic modules without console dependencies
- Scenario 2: Verify consistent console styling across modules
- Scenario 3: Test progress reporting in isolation

**Implementation Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED - Console operations scattered throughout main file

### Requirement 7: Command Organization [P2]

**User Story:** As a developer, I want CLI commands organized into separate modules, so that I can work on specific commands without affecting others.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing command logic THEN each command SHALL reside in its own module
2. WHEN commands share functionality THEN they SHALL use shared service modules
3. WHEN adding new commands THEN they SHALL follow the established module pattern
4. WHEN testing commands THEN each command SHALL be testable in isolation

#### Test Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Test init command independently
