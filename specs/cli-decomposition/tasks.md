# CLI Decomposition Implementation Plan

## Task Prioritization Matrix

### Critical Path (Sequential)
Tasks that must be completed in order due to dependencies:
- Module structure setup → Core layer → Service layer → Command layer → Integration

### Parallel Work (Simultaneous)
Tasks that can be worked on independently:
- Unit tests can be written alongside module extraction
- Documentation updates can happen in parallel with coding

### Optional Enhancements (Nice-to-have)
Features that add value but aren't required for core decomposition:
- Advanced performance optimizations
- Enhanced debugging utilities
- Extended error context

## Progress Summary
**Overall Completion**: 66.7% (10/15 tasks completed)
**Status**: UI layer complete (console + progress), command layer extraction next

## Implementation Gap Analysis
**What's Missing**: Command layer extractions (init, delete, check commands)  
**Why**: UI layer successfully completed - both console management and progress tracking now centralized
**Next Steps**: Begin with Task 5.1 (init command extraction) to start command layer abstraction
