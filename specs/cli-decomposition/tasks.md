# CLI Decomposition Implementation Plan

## Task Prioritization Matrix

### Critical Path (Sequential)
Tasks that must be completed in order due to dependencies:
- Module structure setup → Core layer → Service layer → Command layer → Integration

### Parallel Work (Simultaneous)
Tasks that can be worked on independently:
- Unit tests can be written alongside module extraction
- Documentation updates can happen in parallel with coding

### Optional Enhancements (Nice-to-have)
Features that add value but aren't required for core decomposition:
- Advanced performance optimizations
- Enhanced debugging utilities
- Extended error context

## Progress Summary
**Overall Completion**: 11.1% (2/18 tasks completed)
**Status**: Safety infrastructure established, ready for core module extraction

## Implementation Gap Analysis
**What's Missing**: All core decomposition work - currently have design documents and behavioral baseline safety framework
**Why**: This is a comprehensive refactoring requiring behavioral baseline establishment, protocol-based architecture, and continuous monitoring  
**Next Steps**: Begin with Task 1.1 (module structure setup) now that migration safety foundation is complete
