# Test Coverage Improvements - Branch Issue Fix

## Problem Summary

The CLI failed to download templates because of hardcoded assumptions that weren't caught by tests:

1. **Hardcoded Branch**: Code assumed `main` branch but repository uses `master`
2. **HTTP 302 Error**: GitHub redirected `/main/` → `/master/` which CLI treated as error
3. **Inadequate Test Coverage**: Tests used heavy mocking that hid real-world integration issues

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Tests Didn't Catch It

1. **Over-Mocking**: Unit tests mocked entire HTTP layer, never making real requests
2. **Hardcoded Test Data**: Test fixtures used `improved-sdd-main` paths matching hardcoded production assumptions
3. **No URL Validation**: Zero tests validated actual URLs being constructed
4. **Missing Boundary Tests**: No tests validated integration between code and external GitHub API

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Code Fixes
- ✅ Made GitHubDownloader branch-aware with configurable `branch` parameter
- ✅ Updated all hardcoded `main` references to use configurable branch
- ✅ Set default branch to `master` for this repository
- ✅ Updated dependency injection to pass correct branch

### 2. Test Coverage Improvements

#### Added URL Construction Validation Tests
```python
def test_github_archive_url_construction()
def test_template_prefix_construction_with_branch()
def test_zip_path_parsing_with_custom_branch()
```

#### Added Branch Parameter Tests
```python
def test_init_with_custom_branch()
def test_init_with_all_custom_parameters()
def test_download_templates_with_custom_branch()
```

#### Added Repository Structure Validation
```python
def test_repository_structure_assumptions()
def test_branch_mismatch_detection()
```

#### Added Integration Tests
```python
# New file: tests/integration/test_github_repository_validation.py
def test_repository_configuration_defaults()
def test_template_path_validation()
def test_real_repository_download()  # Optional with network
def test_branch_mismatch_would_fail()
```

#### Updated Test Fixtures
- ✅ Changed hardcoded `improved-sdd-main` to `improved-sdd-master`
- ✅ Added configurable branch fixture `mock_zip_file_custom_branch`
- ✅ Updated all test references to use correct branch

## Tests That Would Have Caught The Bug

### 1. `test_branch_mismatch_detection()`
```python
# Simulates the exact bug scenario
wrong_branch_downloader = GitHubDownloader(branch="main")  # Wrong
correct_branch_downloader = GitHubDownloader(branch="master")  # Correct

# Tests that wrong branch fails to find templates in master ZIP
wrong_matches = [name for name in master_files if name.startswith("improved-sdd-main/")]
assert len(wrong_matches) == 0  # Would have failed with original bug
```

### 2. `test_repository_configuration_defaults()`
```python
# Validates default configuration matches actual repository
downloader = GitHubDownloader()
assert downloader.branch == "master"  # Would have failed if hardcoded to "main"
```

### 3. `test_template_prefix_construction_with_branch()`
```python
# Tests ZIP path parsing with different branches
for branch, expected_prefix in test_cases:
    # Validates that template detection works with correct branch
    # Would have failed with branch mismatch
```

## Validation Results

All new tests pass:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_github_downloader.py -k "custom_branch or repository_structure or branch_mismatch" -v
# ====================== 5 passed, 23 deselected ======================
```

## Prevention Strategy

### Mandatory Test Requirements
1. **URL Construction Tests**: Validate all external URLs before they're used
2. **Configuration Validation**: Test that defaults match actual repository structure
3. **Branch Parameter Tests**: Verify branch configuration affects all URL/path operations
4. **Real-World Integration**: Optional network tests against actual repository
5. **Boundary Testing**: Test integration points between code and external services

### Development Workflow
1. **Repository Changes**: When repository structure changes, update tests first
2. **External Dependencies**: Always test assumptions about external services
3. **Mock Validation**: Ensure mocks reflect real-world behavior
4. **Integration Testing**: Include optional tests against real services

## Impact

- **Immediate**: Fixed CLI download failure (HTTP 302 → success)
- **Long-term**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents similar issues
- **Quality**: Better validation of external service assumptions
- **Confidence**: Tests now validate real-world integration scenarios

The improved test suite provides multiple layers of validation that would catch this type of configuration mismatch before it reaches production.
